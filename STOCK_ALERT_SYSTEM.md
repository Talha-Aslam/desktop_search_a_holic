# Predictive Restocking Alert System

## Overview

The predictive restocking alert system is a comprehensive inventory management feature that automatically monitors product stock levels and provides real-time alerts when products reach predefined low stock thresholds. This system helps prevent stockouts and ensures optimal inventory management.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **StockAlertService** - Main service class for monitoring and managing stock alerts
2. **StockAlertsWidget** - Reusable UI component for displaying alerts
3. **StockAlertsPage** - Dedicated page for viewing and managing all stock alerts
4. **StockStatusIndicator** - Visual indicator component for stock status

### Data Flow

```
Firebase Products Collection → StockAlertService → Real-time Monitoring → Alert Generation → UI Components
```

## Features

### 1. Real-time Monitoring
- Continuous monitoring of product stock levels using Firebase real-time snapshots
- Automatic alert generation when stock levels change
- Background service that runs when the app is active

### 2. Multi-tier Alert System
- **Out of Stock** (Red): 0 units remaining
- **Critical Stock** (Orange): ≤ 5 units remaining  
- **Low Stock** (Yellow): ≤ 10 units remaining
- **Normal Stock** (Green): > 10 units remaining

### 3. Smart Threshold Management
- Default thresholds: Out of Stock (0), Critical (5), Low Stock (10)
- Configurable per business needs
- Automatic evaluation against current inventory levels

### 4. Comprehensive Alert Information
Each alert contains:
- Product name and category
- Current stock quantity
- Alert severity level
- Timestamp and time elapsed
- Recommended action
- Direct link to edit product

### 5. Multiple Display Modes

#### Compact View (Dashboard)
- Shows only critical alerts (out of stock + critical)
- Minimal space footprint
- Quick access to full alerts page

#### Full View (Dedicated Page)
- Complete alert management interface
- Tabbed view by severity level
- Category filtering
- Detailed alert cards with actions

### 6. Visual Stock Indicators
- Color-coded status indicators throughout the app
- Consistent visual language across all screens
- Immediate visual feedback on product cards

## User Interface Components

### Dashboard Integration
```dart
StockAlertsWidget(
  showCompact: true,
  onViewAll: () => Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/stock-alerts'),
)
```

### Product Lists
```dart
StockStatusIndicator(
  quantity: product['quantity'],
  showLabel: false,
)
```

### Dedicated Alerts Page
- Summary cards showing total alerts by type
- Category filtering dropdown
- Tabbed interface (All, Critical, Low Stock, Out of Stock)
- Detailed alert cards with action buttons

## Integration Points

### 1. Main App Setup
```dart
MultiProvider(
  providers: [
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => ThemeProvider()),
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (_) => StockAlertService()),
  ],
  child: MyApp(),
)
```

### 2. Dashboard Monitoring
```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
    final stockAlertService = Provider.of<StockAlertService>(context, listen: false);
    if (!stockAlertService.isMonitoring) {
      stockAlertService.startMonitoring();
    }
  });
}
```

### 3. Navigation Integration
- Added to sidebar navigation
- Direct routes from alerts to product editing
- Seamless flow between components

## Business Logic

### Alert Evaluation Logic
```dart
StockAlert? _evaluateProductStock(Map<String, dynamic> product) {
  int currentStock = (product['quantity'] ?? 0).toInt();
  
  if (currentStock <= 0) {
    return StockAlert(severity: AlertSeverity.danger, ...);
  } else if (currentStock <= 5) {
    return StockAlert(severity: AlertSeverity.critical, ...);
  } else if (currentStock <= 10) {
    return StockAlert(severity: AlertSeverity.warning, ...);
  }
  
  return null; // No alert needed
}
```

### Real-time Updates
- Firebase snapshots listener for instant updates
- Automatic re-evaluation when inventory changes
- Provider pattern for reactive UI updates

## Usage Scenarios

### 1. Daily Operations
- Staff checks dashboard and sees compact alerts
- Critical items are immediately visible
- Quick navigation to restock items

### 2. Inventory Management
- Manager reviews full alerts page
- Filters by category or severity
- Plans restocking schedules

### 3. Point of Sale Integration
- POS shows color-coded stock status
- Prevents overselling of low-stock items
- Automatic alerts after sales transactions

### 4. Proactive Restocking
- Alerts appear before complete stockout
- Multiple warning levels provide flexibility
- Historical tracking of alert patterns

## Technical Implementation

### Service Lifecycle
1. **Initialization**: Service created with app startup
2. **Authentication**: Monitors user login state
3. **Subscription**: Establishes Firebase real-time listener
4. **Evaluation**: Continuous assessment of stock levels
5. **Notification**: Real-time UI updates via Provider
6. **Cleanup**: Proper disposal of resources

### Performance Optimizations
- Single Firebase listener for all products
- Efficient alert evaluation algorithms
- Debounced UI updates to prevent flickering
- Smart caching of alert states

### Error Handling
- Graceful handling of network issues
- Fallback mechanisms for offline scenarios
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry logic

## Configuration Options

### Default Thresholds
```dart
static const int DEFAULT_LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD = 10;
static const int DEFAULT_CRITICAL_STOCK_THRESHOLD = 5;
static const int DEFAULT_OUT_OF_STOCK_THRESHOLD = 0;
```

### Customization Points
- Threshold values per business type
- Alert message templates
- Color schemes and icons
- Display preferences

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **Predictive Analytics**: Machine learning for demand forecasting
