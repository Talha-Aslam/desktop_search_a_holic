# Firestore Composite Index Error Fix

## Problem
You encountered a Firestore composite index error when fetching backup statistics:
```
Error fetching backup stats: [cloud_firestore/failed-precondition] The query requires an index. You can create it here: https://console.firebase.google.com/v1/r/project/healsearch-6565e/firestore/indexes?create_composite=...
```

## Root Cause
The `backup_history_service.dart` was using multiple Firestore queries that combined:
- `.where()` clauses (filtering by userEmail and status)
- `.orderBy()` clauses (sorting by timestamp)
- `.limit()` clauses

These combinations require composite indexes in Firestore, which hadn't been created.

## Solution Applied
Modified all problematic queries in `backup_history_service.dart` to:

1. **Remove `orderBy` from queries** - Query only with `where` clauses
2. **Implement in-memory sorting** - Sort results after fetching from Firestore
3. **Apply limits after sorting** - Ensure correct ordering before limiting results

### Changes Made:

#### 1. `getBackupHistory()` method:
- ❌ **Before**: `.where().orderBy().limit()` (required composite index)
- ✅ **After**: `.where()` only + in-memory sorting + limit application

#### 2. `getBackupStats()` method:
- ❌ **Before**: Multiple complex queries with `.where().where().orderBy()`
- ✅ **After**: Single query + in-memory filtering and sorting

#### 3. `cleanupOldLogs()` method:
- ❌ **Before**: `.where().orderBy().limit()` + cursor pagination
- ✅ **After**: Single query + in-memory sorting + batch deletion

## Benefits
- ✅ **No composite indexes required** - Uses only single-field indexes
- ✅ **Better performance** - Fewer Firestore queries
- ✅ **Same functionality** - Results are identical to before
- ✅ **Consistent with other services** - Matches the pattern used in sales_service.dart and invoice_service.dart

## Testing
The changes maintain the same API and behavior while eliminating the need for composite indexes. Your backup history page should now work without the Firestore index error.

## Next Steps
If you still encounter similar errors with other services:
1. Look for queries combining `.where()` + `.orderBy()`
2. Apply the same pattern: query → in-memory sort → limit
3. This approach works for most use cases where data volumes are reasonable
