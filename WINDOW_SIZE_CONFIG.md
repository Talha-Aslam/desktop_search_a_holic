# Window Size Configuration Summary

## Current Implementation

The Desktop Search A Holic application now uses a **minimum size constraint** approach:

### Window Behavior:
- **Default Size**: 1024x768 pixels
- **Minimum Size**: 1024x768 pixels (locked - cannot be smaller)
- **Maximum Size**: Unlimited (users can resize as large as their screen)
- **Resizable**: Yes, but only larger than minimum

### Key Features:
✅ **Prevents UI Overflow**: Minimum size ensures all UI elements are visible  
✅ **User Flexibility**: Users can make the window as large as they want  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Layout adapts to different window sizes above minimum  
✅ **Fullscreen Support**: F11 key toggles fullscreen mode  
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux  

### How it Works:
1. Application starts at 1024x768 pixels, centered on screen
2. Users can drag window edges to make it larger
3. Window manager prevents resizing smaller than 1024x768
4. If somehow window becomes too small, warning message is displayed
5. F11 key toggles between windowed and fullscreen modes

### User Experience:
- **Flexible**: Users choose their preferred window size
- **Safe**: Minimum constraints prevent layout issues
- **Intuitive**: Standard window resizing behavior
- **Reliable**: Warning system for edge cases

This approach balances user flexibility with UI stability, ensuring the application works well on different screen sizes while preventing layout problems.
